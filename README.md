# Digital VLSI Soc Design and Planning

>2 Week Workshop on Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning organised by VSD in collaboration with NASSSCOM

## DAY 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK

### THEORY

#### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs

Systems in the electronic industry comprise of processing, software, storage and external interface components. In a system all of these sub components would work together to form one central processing system. At the center of this system is a chip. For example, Arduino board (highlighted part is chip).
